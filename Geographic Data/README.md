# Geographic Data

## What's in here?

This folder contains geographic information/data needed to create geofenced areas for our heatmap.

The Raw Data folder contains files such as shapefiles and database files that have been used to create geofences.

The Geofence Point Data folder contains tables with each geographic area (polygon) that will be used for the heatmap and all of the verticies (points) that make up these polygons.
