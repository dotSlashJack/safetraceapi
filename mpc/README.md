# Multi Pary Computation

[What is Secure Multi Party Computation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)

## Package Overview

This Multi Party Computation implementation relies on three major classes:

1. `Circuit` class: A boolean circuit evaluator (see: circuit.py)
2. `MockMessenger` class: P2P communications layer, currently "mocked" with threads (see: messenger.py)
3. `Shamir` class: Shamir Secret Sharing over field GF256 (see: shamir.py)

## Circuits

The `Circuit` class is instanciated with two arguments, a path to a bytecode file and a list of input types:
- Bytecode Files are loaded from 'Bristol Fashion' txt files. Learn more about the bytecode format here: https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~nsmart/MPC/
- Input types are a list of 'V' or 'S' characters where 'S' stands for share and 'V' for value (i.e. a plaintext bit).

The `Circuit` class is made to work in such a way that if only plaintext bits are passed as inputs to the `Circuit` then it can be evaluated 100% locally (the `Circuit` class becomes a simple program executor). However if secret shared bits are passed to the `Circuit` a successful result can only be obtained if a distrbuted set of parties D all run the `Circuit` in parallel (each with their corresponding shares as inputs) where D must be greater than t+1 (and t is the degree of the polynomial from which the secret shares are sampled). When the share outputs are brought together and reconstructed, the correct value of the computation is finally revealed.

A messenger class is only necessary if communication is necessary given the circuit and input types (communication is necessary for any AND gate that takes two share values as input).


## Messengers

Currently only the simple `MockMessenger` is implemented which suffices simply for testing: each party is modeled as a thread on a single machine and a `Queue` is used to "pass messages" between threads.

For MPC in a truly distributed setting, implement a `Messenger` class where messages are sent and received over TLS.

## Shamir Secret Sharing 

The `Shamir` class is a set of methods for a secure (t, n) secret sharing scheme where any t+1 out of n total shares are needed to reconstruct a secret value. The scheme works over the field GF(2^8) for it's applicability to muilti party computtaion with boolean circuits.

```
>>> from shamir import Shamir
>>> shamir = Shamir(2,5)
>>> shares = shamir.share_secret(15)
>>> shares
[(1, 168), (2, 169), (3, 14), (4, 185), (5, 30)]
>>> int(shamir.recontsruct_secret(shares[:3]))
15
>>> shares = shamir.share_bitstring_secret('10010101010010')
>>> shamir.reconstruct_bitstring_secret(shares[2:])
'10010101010010'
```

### Homomorphisms of Shamir Secret Sharing

Shamir Secret Sharing as *linearly* homomorphic out of the box. If each player in the MPC protocol takes an index [1,..,n] and gets their share [x] of secret value x and [y] of secret value y, they can locally combine their shares to get a share [x+y]. Here's proof below:

```
>>> from gf256 import GF256
>>> from shamir import Shamir
>>> x = GF256(1)
>>> y = GF256(2)
>>> shamir = Shamir(2,5)
>>> x_shares = shamir.share_secret(x)
>>> y_shares = shamir.share_secret(y)
>>> result_shares = [x_shares[i]+y_shares[i] for i in range(len(x_shares))]
>>> shamir.reconstruct_secret(result_shares[:3]) == x+y
True
```

Linear homomorphism also means that a secret shared value x may be multiplied by a public value c with simple local computations (by all parties). Each player with share [x] can do c\*[x] to obtain a share [c\*x].

```
>>> from gf256 import GF256
>>> from shamir import Shamir
>>> x = GF256(25)
>>> c = GF256(3)
>>> shamir = Shamir(2,5)
>>> x_shares = shamir.share_secret(x)
>>> result_shares = [share.scalar_mul(c) for share in x_shares]
>>> shamir.reconstruct_secret(result_shares[:3]) == c*x
True
```

Shamir Secret Sharing is similarly *multiplicatively* homomorphic EXCEPT that the threshold number of shares needed for reconstruction doubles after every multiplication. To mitigate this problem there is a preprocessing phase to create a "TripleShare" three values [a],[b],[c] where secret values a,b,c have relationship a\*b=c.

Players first compute:
```
[epsilon] = [x-a]
[rho] = [y-b]
```

Then they broadcast shares [epsilon] and [rho] to all other parties. Players then compute result share [r]:

```
epsilon = reconstruct([epsilon]_1, [epsilon_2]...)
rho = reconstruct([rho]_1, [rho]_2...)
[r] = rho*[x] + epsilon*[y] - epsilon\*rho
[r] = [(y-b)*x] + [(x-a)*y] - (x-a)*(y-b) + c
[r] = [(xy-xb) + (xy-ya) - (xy-ya-xb+ab) + ab]
[r] = [xy]
```

With this protocol (involving one round of communication and pre-created TripleShares) we can compute multiplications homomorphically in the secret shared space. Proof of this can be seen in test_secure_multiplication() in the test file shamir_test.py
